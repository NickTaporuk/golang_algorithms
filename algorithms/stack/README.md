# DESCRIPTION

Stack is a special kind of data structure that follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
strategy. This means that the element that is added last will be the first to be
removed.

#### The various applications of stack are:
1. Recursion: recursive calls are preformed using system stack.
2. Postfix evaluation of expression.
3. Backtracking
4. Depth-first search of trees and graphs.
5. Converting a decimal number into a binary number etc.

#### Stack ADT Operations
· Push(k): Adds a new item to the top of the stack
· Pop(): Remove an element from the top of the stack and return its value.
· Top(): Returns the value of the element at the top of the stack
· Size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack
· IsEmpty(): determines whether the stack is empty. It returns 1 if the stack is
empty or return 0.

    Note: All the above Stack operations are implemented in O(1) Time Complexity.
